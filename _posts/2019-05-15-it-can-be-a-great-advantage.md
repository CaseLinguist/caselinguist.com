Is it possible to choose keywords at a stage that hinders the objective?

### The Initial Value
Imagine that one SEO gets to work on a project. Now that SEO completes the first round of data-gathering for the first leg of the task. On an optimized text, we recognize the nuances between one phrase as spoken and the other as one would in search.  Like the pre-NCIS days when a security camera had infinite resolution -- how do we begin to ”enhance” that which we have already ”enhanced.”  This is the moment of translation when optimization is most important -- yet the modern SEO is left detached from the crucial process of scoping high-value intent.

###  The Quality Path
A large agency might favor the outsourcing path.  While beneficial to gather metrics using a plethora of translators, reviewers,  the success axis trims on the negative side.  The ”quality assurance” reviewers become as close as you can get to effective SEOs and a critical point in the process.

The fight is to dispense with static snapshots as the deliverable, where dynamic readouts are crucial. 

The job of translation and SEO requires a keen ear to the flows of information.  Keyword research, whether in Spanish or not, must be dynamic -- or risk a process that is quietly lagging.

With a gathered set of keywords, starting the literal translation process at this point hinders the objective.   Instead of tracking the correct meaning through careful research and keyword volume tools,  we have left the meaning behind and instead introduced ”literal” interpretations.

Advantages like using the same professional for both SEO as a translator and as content analyst lets you directly address the value of SEO in Spanish.

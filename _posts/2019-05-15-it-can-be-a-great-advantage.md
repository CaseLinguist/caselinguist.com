Is it possible to target keywords at a stage that hinders the objective?

One SEO is tasked with and initializes a analysis-based workflow for your website.  As expected, the analyst completes the first round of data-gathering for the first leg of work -- creating the pool of possible words to focus on.  On an optimized text, recognizing nuances between one written phrase and its closest peer is at the core of having a human work on this crucial gathering  process.  

### Spanish language word set
How do we make sure we have not basically entered into a benign post-processing step? Imagine early tech in films; the pre-NCIS days when a security camera had seemingly infinite resolution.  How do we begin to ”enhance” that which we have already ”enhanced?”  This is the moment of translation when optimization is most important -- yet the modern SEO is at risk of being left detached from the crucial process of scoping high-value intent at the moment where a proper foundation is built.

A large agency might favor the outsourcing path.  Remaining beneficial to gather metrics using a plethora of translators, reviewers,  proof readers.  The succes of spanish SEO success may trim and fall short to the negative side: ineffective translation of once optimized content -- content suited for bot consumption in English.   The ”quality assurance” reviewers are all that may be as close as you can get to capable SEOs at a critical point in the process.

The fight is to dispense with static snapshots as the deliverable, where dynamic readouts are crucial. 

The job of translation and SEO requires a keen ear to the flows of information.  Keyword research, whether in Spanish or not, must be dynamic -- or risk a process that is quietly lagging.

With a gathered set of keywords, starting the literal translation process at this point hinders the objective.   Instead of tracking the correct meaning through careful research and keyword volume tools,  we have left the meaning behind and instead introduced ”literal” interpretations.

Advantages like using the same professional for both SEO as a translator and as content analyst lets you directly address the value of SEO in Spanish.

Imagine that one SEO gets to work on a piece of a project. Now that SEO completes the first round of data-gathering for the first leg of the task. On an optimized text, we recognize the nuances between how one phrase is used in, for example, the midwest vs how it's used on the west coast.  Using this, or any example, how do we begin to ”enhance” that which we have already ”enhanced”?

With a gathered set of keywords, starting the literal translation process at this point hinders the objective.    Instead of tracking the correct meaning in through keyword volume tools,  we have left the meaning behind on the workshopped area of user intent.

It can be a great advantage to rely on the same SEO expert for content strategy and translation services. Otherwise, you might lose important details in the process to and from the SEO content strategist and the translator.

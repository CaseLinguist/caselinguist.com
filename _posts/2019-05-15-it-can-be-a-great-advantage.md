Is it possible to translate keyword choices at a stage that hinders the objective?

Imagine that one SEO gets to work on a project. Now that SEO completes the first round of data-gathering for the first leg of the task. On an optimized text, we recognize the nuances between how one phrase is spoken and searched.  Using this, or any example, how do we begin to ”enhance” that which we have already ”enhanced” when attaching the task of translation?

A powerful big data agency is large enough to gather or infer success metrics using a plethora of translators, reviewers,  and if SEO sat on an x,y plane, its on the negative side.  The ”quality assurance” reviewers become as close as you can get to effective SEOs and a critical point in the process.

That brings me to the question of ”are you ok with the idea of your business being someone else's guinea pig?

A job that should require ”a strong ear” to the flows of information is in the above circumstance static at best.  

Keyword research, whether in Spanish or not, must be dynamic -- or risk ending up in the snapshot-scape that is constantly and  quietly lagging.

With a gathered set of keywords, starting the literal translation process at this point hinders the objective.    Instead of tracking the correct meaning in through keyword volume tools,  we have left the meaning behind on the workshopped area of user intent.

Advantages fo using the same SEO as translator
It can be a great advantage to rely on the same SEO expert for content strategy and translation services. Otherwise, you might lose important details in the process to and from the SEO content strategist and the translator.

Is it possible to target keywords at a stage that hinders the objective?

One SEO is tasked with and initializes a analysis-based workflow for your website.  As expected, the analyst completes the first round of data-gathering  -- creating the pool of possible words to focus on.  On an optimized text, recognizing nuances between one written phrase and its closest peer is at the core of having a human work on this crucial gathering  process.  

### Spanish language word set
How do we make sure we have not basically entered into a benign post-processing step? Imagine, like I am, early tech in films; the pre-NCIS days when a security camera had seemingly infinite resolution.  How do we begin to ”enhance” that which we have already ”enhanced?”  This is the moment of translation when optimization is most important -- yet the modern SEO is at risk of being left detached from the crucial process of scoping high-value intent at the moment where a proper foundation is built.

A large agency might favor the translation outsourcing path.  The risk here is to lose the ability to remain beneficial and to gather metrics using a plethora of translators, reviewers and proof readers.  The succes of spanish SEO success may trim and fall short to the negativity of ineffective translation. Once optimized, content suited for bot consumption in English are exported to ”quality assurance” reviewers of the coherence of the language at best.  Beware, as with a large agency, that level of detail may be as close as you can get to capable SEOs at a critical point in the process.

The fight is to dispense with static snapshots.  Assure the deliverable are dynamic readouts of market information. 

The job of translation and SEO requires a keen ear to the flows of information.  Keyword research, whether in Spanish or not, must be dynamic -- or risk a process that is quietly lagging.

With a gathered set of keywords, starting the literal translation process at this point hinders the objective.   Instead of tracking the correct meaning through careful research and keyword volume tools,  we have left the meaning behind and instead introduced ”literal” interpretations.

Advantages like using the same professional for both SEO as a translator and as content analyst lets you directly address the value of SEO in Spanish.

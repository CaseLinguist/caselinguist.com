Hello, I run Marketing for Lawyers "organic" SEO for small firms.  I also offer flexible services that serve lawyers starting a solo practice.
As an SEO at Case Linguist LLC, my superficial knowledge of the legal system is coupled with a style of research and client reporting I enjoy.

Having clients find your legal service is an aim I care about.   Firms that would benefit from SEO services are those who may already have started a webpage. However, as time goes on, it is clear they are missing a marketing edge with possible direct competitors.

Find out who your organic competitors are.  Maximize the potential of paid campaigns by contacting Marketing for Lawyers.

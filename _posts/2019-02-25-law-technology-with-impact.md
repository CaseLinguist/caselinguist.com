Hello, My name is René and I run Marketing for Lawyers. I offer flexible SEO services for small firms and solo practice.

In researching and building an SEO strategy, I draw on my training as a court interpreter training (in Spanish). I bring my knowledge of legal marketing with my understanding of online data visualization to create a unique SEO plan for each client.

After a phone call to get set up, plan on having clients better locate your impactful legal services through online engagement. Lawyers that would benefit from digital technology services are those recently opening a legal office. Nevertheless, the aim is to have the principal attorney notice an edge over a selection of direct competitors you have ...and organic competitors you were not aware of.

Work with an SEO that specializes in the good work that you do.

-R

Hello, My name is Ren√© and I run Marketing for Lawyers for small firms.  These are flexible services also applicable to solo practice.

Researching SEO takes linguistic court interpreter training (in Spanish), as I patiently combine my superficial knowledge of the legal system with a style of data reporting and client interaction I enjoy.

After a phone call to get set up, plan on having clients better locate your impactful legal services through online engagement. Lawyers that would benefit from digital technology services are those recently opening a legal office. Nevertheless, the aim is to have the principal attorney notice an edge over a selection of direct competitors you have ...and organic competitors you were not aware of.

Work with an SEO that specializes in the good work that you do.

Hello, My name is Ren√© and I run Marketing for Lawyers for small firms.  These flexible services also serve lawyers starting a solo practice.
As an SEO at Case Linguist LLC, my superficial knowledge of the legal system is coupled with a style of research and client reporting I enjoy.

Having clients get to and engage your impactful legal services is an aim I care about.  Lawyers that would benefit from digital technology services are those opening a legal office. The 'before picture' can be an attorney who has started a webpage and may already write content on their website. Nevertheless, the attorney notices very little marketing edge over direct competitors.

After working with a Case Linguist SEO, you will find out who your search engine competitors are.

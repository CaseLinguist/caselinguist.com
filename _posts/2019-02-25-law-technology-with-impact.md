Hello,

My name is [Ren√©]({{ "/about/" | relative_url }} "About Case Linguist LLC"), and I run Case Linguist _Marketing for Lawyers_. I offer flexible SEO services for small firms and solo practice.

In researching and building an SEO strategy, I draw on my training as a court interpreter (in Spanish). I bring my knowledge of legal marketing and my understanding of online data visualization to create a unique SEO plan for each client.

In a relatively short amount of time, you can plan on having clients better locate your impactful legal services through online engagement. You will gain a competitive edge over direct competitors.   In addition, you might become aware of prospective clients you have not previously considered or attracted to your business.

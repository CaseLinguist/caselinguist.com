Many business owners have turned to Google up to and including Bing to obtain automatically generated translations of their existing website content. We call these automatic translations _machine translations_.

Machine translations have the benefit of being cheap. Unfortunately, they tend to generate mistakes that can be misleading for prospective clients. When Google observes that your users become confused and leave your website prematurely, they might lower your relevancy rating.
This, in turn, will make it more difficult for future clients to find you.  
Fortunately, an SEO expert with fluency in Spanish can help you avoid this pitfall and the unfortunate after-effects.

Cost-effectiveness is one of the primary considerations for any small law firm considering SEO.
I work to ensure cost-effectiveness through something called _spot submissions_.  
A _spot submission_ is taking the glaringly obvious machine translation 'errors' and transforming them to fit the context and register.  Submitting those to Google, the machine translation rendered on the page has less opportunity to trip a person up.

## How do you know if your website already uses machine translation?

Look on your website for a drop-down menu listing many different languages (see below). If you see a dropdown menu like this one, then you can pretty sure that your website is using machine translation. You know this because you most likely did not pay the translator to translate your website into all of these languages.

A machine is making these translations on the basis of it's own internal dictionary.  Of course, the machine is vulnerable to making all of the literal word-to-word mistakes that a native speaker would avoid. For example you might use the word "facilities."  An English-to-Spanish machine might offer the literal translation, "things we have no problem with" (_facilidades_). Needless to say, this would confuse your readers.


## Why my services are cost-effective

Machine translation appeals to many business owners because, in most cases, it is free or inexpensive. However, it might bring unforeseen costs. For example, it might cause you to lose potential clients who leave your site in frustration. Google tracks this activity in the form of a "Bounce rate."  The higher your bounce rate ( i.e the more users who leave your site in a short matter of time ), the lower you will appear in Google searches.  Not only will you lose these frustrated users, you will miss out on future customers who search for your services.  By perfecting your website translation, I ensure that your content will make sense to Spanish speakers.  You will be much more likely to win their business.  In addition, because they spend more time reading your website, you will have a lower bounce rate, and will appear higher in Google searches overall.  This will help current and future clients to find your legal services.


### Significant considerations in integrating translations.

- Is it global (we are not)
- Is it local? (yes we are)
- Do you need to have a Spanish version of everything?


### On submitting targeted translations

We have the option to submit a sitemap that details the structure of the webpage, so why not clue-in a web search engine into the correct intent through flag-in-the-sand translation?

### Examples of Pitfalls



{% include figure.html image_source="machine-options-sink.png" alt="county website with translation offering" %}


### Separately maintained translation

{% include figure.html image_source="solid-options.png" alt="website few but solid translation options" %}

The above has few, but markedly solid offerings.  

Why is this better?  In the first website, we try to show the distinction in meaning:

<!-- {% include figure.html image_source="machine-menu.png" alt="auto translated county website" %}    -->

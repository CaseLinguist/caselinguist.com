Many business owners have turned to Google up to and including Bing to obtain automatically generated translations of their existing website content. We call these automatic translations _machine translations_.

### Generated

Machine translations have the benefit of being cheap. Unfortunately, they tend to generate mistakes that can be misleading for prospective clients. When Google observes that your users become confused and leave your website prematurely, they might lower your relevancy rating.
This, in turn, will make it more difficult for future clients to find you.  
Fortunately, an SEO expert with fluency in Spanish can help you avoid this pitfall and the unfortunate after-effects.

Cost-effectiveness is one of the primary considerations for any small law firm considering SEO.
I work to ensure cost-effectiveness through something called _spot submissions_.  
A _spot submission_ is taking the glaringly obvious machine translation 'errors' and transforming them to fit the context and register.  Submitting those to Google, the machine translation rendered on the page has less opportunity to trip a person up.

## How do you know if your website already uses machine translation?

Look on your website for a drop-down menu listing many different languages (see below). If you see a dropdown menu like this one, then you can pretty sure that your website is using machine translation. You know this because you most likely did not pay the translator to translate your website into all of these languages.

A machine is making these translations on the basis of its own internal dictionary. Of course, the machine is vulnerable to making all of the literal word-to-word mistakes that a native speaker would avoid. For example, you might use the word "facilities."  An English-to-Spanish machine might offer the literal translation, "things we have no problem with" (_facilidades_). Needless to say, this would confuse your readers.


## Why my services are cost-effective

Machine translation appeals to many business owners because, in most cases, it is free or inexpensive. However, it might bring unforeseen costs. For example, it might cause you to lose potential clients who leave your site in frustration. Google tracks this activity in the form of a "Bounce rate."  The higher your bounce rate ( i.e the more users who leave your site in a short matter of time ), the lower you will appear in Google searches.  Not only will you lose these frustrated users, but you will also miss out on future customers who search for your services.  By perfecting your website translation, I ensure that your content will make sense to Spanish speakers.  You will be much more likely to win their business.  In addition, because they spend more time reading your website, you will have a lower bounce rate and will appear higher in Google searches overall.  This will help current and future clients to find your legal services.


### Significant considerations in integrating translations.

A contracted translation is ideal when your budget is large for the hypothetical that gaining 30 to 40 pages of assets, that are difficult to update, is a horrible position to be in.  The small team wastes little time often by necessity.  Every newly-generated resource may even be housed on a separate web page.  Its purpose is a duplication in efforts. value wanes at sub-par for applying a big-business solution to an asset better handled by a smaller SEO firm.


Without duplicated efforts, optimization in a website still gain search capabilities.  Key editing made at points in the page will prepare Google machine-translation to make smooth translations, and not create over-translations.

Avoid creating a copy of your website and undoing the engineering by having it side by side, forced into existence on your website. Contributing language in Spanish, reaches nothing.  Using that what you get from doing applying mirror-like duplication on a global scale, benefits no one. The exception being that your resources exist in different countries to already produce on a global scale.  This high-budget route requires on-demand resources of space and bandwidth.

In searching for services, check that the provided implementation is free of technical assumptions intent on a hand-off to in-place global assets.  The field is large but for your purposes the target tight.

Criminal and immigration law websites concerned with going global is not of concern in this article.  Posed to capture clients that are in the United States, we may live in a big city.  A client Googles avoiding the sites that may tangentially apply to a Spain transplant or the Venezuela transplant.  The first hit provide results from Venezuela, fore example.

Set to a different language, problems arise when a computer identifies as same device that the client always uses.   Steps are usually not isolated to one query. By contrast, they are performed in pairs or executed in groups of three or four.  Before finding legal services, it is important to apply prudent local search optimization.

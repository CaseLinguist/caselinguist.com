<div class="row">
    <div class="col s12 m7">
      <div class="card small ">
        <div class="card-image">
          <picture>
            {% include normalized.html image_source="machine-list.jpg" alt="count website with translation offering showing over 30 language options" %}
          </picture>
          <span class="card-title black-text">All Languages</span>

Many business owners have turned to Google up to and including Bing to obtain automatically generated translations of their existing website content. We call these automatic translations _machine translations_.

Machine translations have the benefit of being cheap. Unfortunately, they tend to generate mistakes that can be misleading for prospective clients. When Google observes that your users become confused and leave your website prematurely, they might lower your relevancy rating.
This, in turn, will make it more difficult for future clients to find you.  
Fortunately, an SEO expert with fluency in Spanish can help you avoid this pitfall and the unfortunate after-effects.

Cost-effectiveness is one of the primary considerations for any small law firm considering SEO.
I work to ensure cost-effectiveness through something called _spot submissions_.  
A _spot submission_ is taking the glaringly obvious machine translation 'errors' and transforming them to fit the context and register.  Submitting those to Google, the machine translation rendered on the page has less opportunity to trip a person up.

## Why my services are cost-effective

There are different stages of combining the necessary digital materials to construct a thorough website together with effective SEO. Having the benefit of all this website structure knowledge is tough.  Furthermore, being armed with this at the onset of website creation, is rare. Building upon the initial work, it is best to consider adding features to your web presence implementation as you and your company grow.

### Significant considerations in integrating translations.

- Is it global (we are not)
- Is it local? (yes we are)
- Do you need to have a Spanish version of everything?

### On submitting targeted translations

We have the option to submit a sitemap that details the structure of the webpage, so why not clue-in a web search engine into the correct intent through flag-in-the-sand translation?

### Examples of Pitfalls

<div class="row">
    <div class="col s12 m7">
      <div class="card horizontal ">
        <div class="card-image">
          <picture>
            {% include normalized.html image_source="machine-menu.png" alt="Auto (machine) translated county website" %}
          </picture>
        </div>
        <div class="card-content">
          <p>Here is a translation example.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
   </div>

 <div class="row">
     <div class="col s12 m7">
       <div class="card horizontal ">
         <div class="card-image">
           <picture>
             {% include normalized.html image_source="machine-options-sink.png" alt="county website with translation offering" %}
           </picture>
         </div>
         <div class="card-content">
           <p>This is the featured and passively translated page.</p>
         </div>
       </div>
     </div>
   </div>


### Separately maintained translation

<div class="row">
    <div class="col s12 m7">
      <div class="card small ">
        <div class="card-image">
          <picture>
            {% include normalized.html image_source="solid-options.png" alt="website few but solid translation options" %}
          </picture>
        </div>
        <div class="card-content">
          <p>Going with targeted translation is thorough but not cost-effective.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

The above has few, but markedly solid offerings.  

Why is this better?  In the first website, we try to show the distinction in meaning:

"Things we have no problem with" to translate "Our facilities."
In this context search tool *facilidades* does not appear at all:

    <p>
      You may have heard of translations of expressions
      that sound funny in English.  Or vice versa,
      maybe you've tried to speak a few inert words
      in a foreign language, and suddenly everyone is
      up in arms! SEO is similar, in that it's meaning is
      uniquely affected based on who and where that target language is written.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to think about spanish SEO while training
      as a court interpreter in Chicago.
      I learned that, if you stay true
      to the meaning of the search term,
      as if it had been said in English,
      then the marketing impact will likely be the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to approach language localization over a two-year timespan
      in the Chicago tech show space. Collaborating on a weekly basis, I was
      answering coding questions one-on-one, with the architects of prominent
      civic apps, such as Expunge.io, working to get to a wider audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I leverage data to provide dynamically-applicable recommendations.
      I will tailor a solution to fit the unique needs of your legal practice
      and make sure that clients are finding your services in English and
      in Spanish. The first step is to schedule a free phone consultation.
      Don't wait. Use the
      <a href='{{ "/contact/" | relative_url }}'>contact link</a>
      to reach out and start taking advantage of the SEO optimization process.
